# HTTP Protocol, JSON and API's

This class will first recap how the internet actually works.

We will look look at GET request and POST request,

Once we understand the difference we will look at what is an API

Then we will call API, using GET and POST request and get back JSON

we will also look at what is JSON

## HTTP GET and POST

Add Picture Here

## JSON

JSON is basically a dictionary in JS (javascript =! java)
Javascript Object Notation

## API's
Application Programing Interface

... I think it should be An inteface for PROGRAMS to talk to OTHER programs

Where an old rotating telephone thing where you select the number is a good for humans it is not appropriate for machines

API is the right interface for SERVERS to talk to SERVERS

Baisically it exposes a service in a standardised way. USING JSON!

Examples of application:
- get access to a database / life data (postcodes.io, tfl)
- get access to a service. (twill.io, google image recognition)
- and many others




## CALLING API with GET

## CALLIN API with POST + JSON

## Interpreting JSON into a dicctionary (so we can use it)

## Creating a JSON () from a dictionary or a string.

## Status Code

200's - GOOD
300'S Authentication error
400's Backend messed up
